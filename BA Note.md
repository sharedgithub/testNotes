### 6. What is SDLC ?

a. SDLC - Software development life cycle - Requirement gathering, development, deployement, maintainance - it is for software change - Plan , create, test, deploy, maintain

b. SDLC - System development life cycle - People, process, physical architecture, training, orginization annoucements - it is for people or orginization process change

### 7. Methodologies - Selection of best methodology is depending of projet team, business requirement, availablity of sources, fit for business

* a. Waterfall - linear, traditional, o/p of first is input for next, fully planned and budgeted

benifits - clear requirement, schedule, planned, extensive documentation, progress is easily measurable

cons - rigid, inflexible, probles are discovered during testing, promopts gaps between business & developement team.
When to use - requirements are clear,no pressure on immediate returns, requirements are stable,Strict requirement for formal approvals at milestones

* b. Incremental Model - Combination of linear and iterative approach, mini water fall, allows easier change of requirements, Focuses on delivering customer value 

benefits -  Provides early value in the development, requirement changes are allowed, problems can be detected earlier, can utilize problems in next iteration

Cons - heavy documents, can losses business objective,difficult problems can lead to push next iteration
When to use -Large projects where requirements are not understood, big project with new technology or requirement, changing requirements, business users are mandatory, need functional requirements tangible quickly

* c. Sprial Model - Combination of linear and iterative, heavy risk projects, each cycle ends with review

benefits - Accurately manages and mitigates risks, issues are identifies at start and risks are mitigated

Cons - high budget, long time, very customised cannot be resuable

when to use - RIsk is high, resources are availble, no budget issues

* d. Agile SCrum - iterative approach (sprint), at each sprint working model is delivered

Prons - flexible, requirements can be change, collaboration,daily feedback, stops “spinning wheels”

Cons - Leads to scope creep due to no defined end date, Challenging to initially adopt, train in an organization, Changing or leaving team members can have a drastically negative effect

When to use - Using or creating leading edge technology, Organization as an experienced Scrum Master, Pressure to produce a tangible product quickly, Development team doesn’t have resource constraints

* e. Rapid Developement - Incremental approach, Components and functions are developed in parallel, Developments have tight timeframes, Feedback is received and prototype is refined, Repeated until product fully meets requirements

Benefits - Reduce time to development, resusable product, fast

cons - need strong team, modular approach with experience team memebers, high risk

When to use - system which can be modularized and needs to complete in 2 to 3 months, strong team is availble

anyone as per company, VPs/directors, Managers, BA

### 12. Phases to an Effective Business Case
 a. Analysis - identify problem or opportunity or need, determine high level requirements, collect data needed to support business case (ROI), validate decision with high level return, analys liklihood projects to be approved and if should continue
 
 b. Potential Solution - Benefits, cost, time & schedule, risk, one of your solution should be do nothing

 c. Write Business case - Executive summary, problem statement, analysis, solutions, cost-benefits analysis, recommendation  

 d. Review Business case - validate problem statement, ensure solutions are valid, double check cost-benefits, your recommendation, correct spelling, review document by another person, get project buyin

 e. Present Business case - remind yourself that your solution is not known to anybody, clearly define problems and business acts, give recommendation, explain ROI, touch each risk level, mention your stekholder backer, summarizing presentation with ROI
 
### 13. What is stekholders ?

- indv or groups are directly or indirectly affetcted by activities done by project. (Team memeber, Project team, customer, business user, sponseror, city/community, supoorting team, supplier, employees)

### 14. Why to identify stekholder ? 

- correct requirements, support, more ideas, more inputs, Risks, solutions, gain buyin,increase creditiblity

### 15. How to identify stekholders ?

 a. go through with anticipated scope or requirements or project chartered
     - who are the beneficiary

## ----Chapter 6 ---- Requirement Elicitation - pulling out requirements by different techniques

### 25.  What is Eliciation ? - getting business requirements from users or stekholders determine business needs, understanding business constraints and limitations
what system is doing and what system needs to do

### 26. What is Eliciting or Gathering ? - Gathering means order taking but Eliciting ask questions and documents needs

### 27. How to elicitate requirement ?- 
* a. Brainstorming - Solving problems, generate ideas & create Consensus/solution
Types - 
Individua brain stroming - Project team memeber
Open brainstroming - get it in room with stekholders
Structured - Participants writing ideas and facilator go to each person and ask for their ideas

Prons :Generate multiple ideas, involve multiple ppl, promotes equal participaints 

Cons :ideas are not discussed in detailed, True meaning of idea may be ambiguous or misunderstood.

Best Practices - 
	1. Define agenda
	2. Determine brain storming meeting in advance
	3. Clearly state objective of meeting
	4. Craete envirorment to encourage participaints
	5. Ask questions or clarifications during brain storming

* b. Requirement workshop - get business groups in room and understand requirements

Agenda is set
Process is understood
dives into details and make some decision and get validated with business so that getting consensus

Types -
Formal requirement process workshop - strick agenda, selected stekholders, define, create, refine and reach closure to business requirements

Business process improvement workshop - semi formal, analys existing process and define new and agree with new improveded process

agile requirement workshop - unstructured and informal, used to generally document requirements

Prons - Effective, greate chance of contain consensus as issues or doubts are clear at real time, stekholder buy in, document is ready by end and can be given for review and final approval.

Cons - difficult to get right ppl in room at same time, can be expensive

Best Practices - determined workshop ahead a time, be clear with session output, utilize modelling tool or visual images, 

* c. Interviewing - Systematic discussion on requirements, gain high level needs, process, constarint, one to one or with small group, see process requirements from interviewees perpesctive

Type -

Personal Interview - ready with scripted questions
Job shadowing - Walk through a work thgrought a day with user and observing them
Customer Site Visit - Understand Operational environment they workin, understand environment contrainsts
Task Analysis - End user to walk through with requirements, understand as is process, interviewer ask question what is working fine, and what is not

Prons - Promote interactive conversesstion, identify conflits or discrepencies, enable to understand non verbal behavior

Cons - creating scripted question time consuming, stekholder might have difficulties in future process, Tranacription & analysis of interview data can be complex & time consuming

Best Practice - Determine best interview type, schedule meeting ahead time, Respect person by being on time and dispaly interest, check understanding often, Let interviewee what will be done with informations, ask for examples, interview two to three person of same category

Interview document generally contains:
	Name of interviewee
	Role of person and their primary responsibilities
	Open-ended questions
	Space for answers
	Space for interviewers’ insights
	Action item box for flagging key pieces of information
	Requirement, new requirement risk, assumption, or constraint


### Sample Interview Questions -
* What are other ways you accomplish this goal?
* Tell me about your frustrations with this process
* What makes a good day? A bad day?
* If you could wave your magic wand and make it different, what would the process look like?
* What standards or regulations should we be aware of?
* What purpose is accomplished by using the product or process?
* What equipment, tools, templates, and inputs do people need to use it?
* How long should tasks take?
* What people do you share information with?
* What failures cause the organization the most pain?
* What didn’t I ask that I should have?
* If we could only change one thing in    the process, what should it be?

* d. Survey - Question ask to stekholders to qualify their thoughts or Review of data from data base verifing log time, failures 
Types -
Open ended question - ask open ended question with text box like what they think about current process - difficult to analysis or survey to get quantified data
closed ended question - Finite set of anwser for question, used for statistical analysis

Prons -Scalable for large audience, fast and inexpensive

Cons -  response rate is low, open ended question required more analysis

### Best Pratice - 
* Focus your questions on high-priority risks that have been identified
* Identify user satisfaction levels with existing systems to set a baseline
* Questions should be direct and unambiguous
* Save complex questions for later in the survey
* Save demographic information for last
* Create rewards for participating
* Create the survey with inexpensive online tools
* Notify the participants when the survey is available and         
* continue to remind them to participate

* e. Document Review - Study of available documents

* f. Analyzing Interfaces - analysis existing interfaces, input/ output data and medium, describe manual or automated process

## ----- Chapter 7 ------ Requirement Analsis

### 28. What is Visual modelling ? - Graphical representation using modelling language e.g wokflow, process flow,Orginizational chart, matrix . take something complex and make it simple


Benefits - visual images are easy to understand, receive requirement efficiently,identify underlying problems,allows to remove irrelevant information

As is prosess is model and model to be processs and find out gaps


### 29. What is requirement analysis ?

stekholder to understand requirement
understand requirement need to prioritize
design team to analyze requirements

### 30. Business Models ?

a. Orginizational chart - heirarchy, roles and deparments
b. Compentative comparision matrix - comparision of available options or platforms, services or platforms
c. Stekholder model - show stekholders involved in project
d. Use Case diagram - how is going to use application
e. process flow diagram - process from start to end - unit lele >> task level
f. User interface wireframe - It shows how application will look like - design of particular application

### 31. Technical Models ?
a. System context digram - how system will processed with database details etc, how data will flow - high level diagram
b. Data Flow digram - data flow from one place to another - helps to understand requirement
c. CRUD - Create, Read, Update and delete - role wise details - Process vs entity, process vs role - database table details
d. State digram - states of application at different stages
e. Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)- Database design diagram (entity)

### 32. BPMN and UML modelling

### 33. When to get technical team into project - once requirement eliciation is completed.

## ------ chapter 8----Requirement Specifications ---- deriving requirements, categorizing requirements, Prioritizing requirements, estimating requirements, identifing requirement needs further ivenstigations

### 34.  Categorizing requirements ? - for documenting, help to prioritizing requirement, estimating system cost, not clear requirement
Functional (product must do), non functional (time response, property) ,products constraints (1000 user accessing system)

### 35. Deriving Requirement means ?

adding further details to requireemnt,adding clearity to requirement, removing ambiguity

a. Parsing requirements - breaking down the requirement broad requirement, removing and from requirement- 
example - Original Requirement:
“User-completed fields on tax forms shall be converted to electronic text documents.”

Parsed Requirements:
“The system shall be able to convert handwriting to text.”
“The system shall be able to convert machine print to text.”
“The system shall be able to electronically correct user-completed fields.”

b. Interpreting Requirements -Reducing generalized statements and ambiguity
example -
Original Requirement:
“Each PC shall have state-of-the-art software installed.”

Interpreted Requirement:
“Each PC shall have Microsoft Office 2013 and Windows 10 installed.”

Parsed Requirements:
“Each PC shall have Microsoft Office 2013 installed.”
“Each PC shall have Windows 10 installed.”

c. Focusing Requirements - combining overlapping requirements
example - 
Original Requirements:
“Each PC must have a standard spreadsheet tool installed that runs in Windows.”

Focused Requirement:
“Each PC on the LAN shall have Microsoft Office Excel 2013.”

d. Qualifying requirements - add verifications and complience (measurable)
example -
Original Requirement:
“The xxx command must peform the following actions…”

Focused Requirement:
“Each command shall be executed during system testing to demonstrate its functionality.”

36. Assigning Requirement attributes - clarifications, filtering, validation

Uniqe identifier - m
Acceptace criteria - m
author
complexity
ownership - m
performance
urgency (help in iterative projects)
business value (description for business purpose) -m
status - m
type
priority
source-m

37. Why Prioritization is required ? - if too many requirement then not possible to fulfill all so to identify which needs to be implemented within schdeule and budget

38. Prioritization Factor ?
a. Value to business
b. Value to customer
c. minimize cost to develope
d. time to implementation
e. ease to technical implementation
f. ease to business implementation
g. Obligation to extrnal authority

39. Steps for Prioritization ?
a. Business value
b. estimate cost
c. determine time

40. Validating Requirement means - go through with requirement again and SMART techniques

41. Business Requirement Document - FInal document having all requirements, business rules, use case, business values, versioning, assumption, solutions, Approvals, stekholder list,Glossary, Appendix - Business process diagram, orginization structure, reports formats, rules, models

------ Chapter 9 ---- Requirement Approval - Approval from Stekholders , Teachnical team and Sponsor review
