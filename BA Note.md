### 6. What is SDLC ?

a. SDLC - Software development life cycle - Requirement gathering, development, deployement, maintainance - it is for software change - Plan , create, test, deploy, maintain

b. SDLC - System development life cycle - People, process, physical architecture, training, orginization annoucements - it is for people or orginization process change

### 7. Methodologies - Selection of best methodology is depending of projet team, business requirement, availablity of sources, fit for business

* a. Waterfall - linear, traditional, o/p of first is input for next, fully planned and budgeted

benifits - clear requirement, schedule, planned, extensive documentation, progress is easily measurable

cons - rigid, inflexible, probles are discovered during testing, promopts gaps between business & developement team.
When to use - requirements are clear,no pressure on immediate returns, requirements are stable,Strict requirement for formal approvals at milestones

* b. Incremental Model - Combination of linear and iterative approach, mini water fall, allows easier change of requirements, Focuses on delivering customer value 

benefits -  Provides early value in the development, requirement changes are allowed, problems can be detected earlier, can utilize problems in next iteration

Cons - heavy documents, can losses business objective,difficult problems can lead to push next iteration
When to use -Large projects where requirements are not understood, big project with new technology or requirement, changing requirements, business users are mandatory, need functional requirements tangible quickly

* c. Sprial Model - Combination of linear and iterative, heavy risk projects, each cycle ends with review

benefits - Accurately manages and mitigates risks, issues are identifies at start and risks are mitigated

Cons - high budget, long time, very customised cannot be resuable

when to use - RIsk is high, resources are availble, no budget issues

* d. Agile SCrum - iterative approach (sprint), at each sprint working model is delivered

Prons - flexible, requirements can be change, collaboration,daily feedback, stops “spinning wheels”

Cons - Leads to scope creep due to no defined end date, Challenging to initially adopt, train in an organization, Changing or leaving team members can have a drastically negative effect

When to use - Using or creating leading edge technology, Organization as an experienced Scrum Master, Pressure to produce a tangible product quickly, Development team doesn’t have resource constraints

* e. Rapid Developement - Incremental approach, Components and functions are developed in parallel, Developments have tight timeframes, Feedback is received and prototype is refined, Repeated until product fully meets requirements

Benefits - Reduce time to development, resusable product, fast

cons - need strong team, modular approach with experience team memebers, high risk

When to use - system which can be modularized and needs to complete in 2 to 3 months, strong team is availble

 c. Write Business case - Executive summary, problem statement, analysis, solutions, cost-benefits analysis, recommendation  

 d. Review Business case - validate problem statement, ensure solutions are valid, double check cost-benefits, your recommendation, correct spelling, review document by another person, get project buyin

 e. Present Business case - remind yourself that your solution is not known to anybody, clearly define problems and business acts, give recommendation, explain ROI, touch each risk level, mention your stekholder backer, summarizing presentation with ROI
